# Carbon Design System

A framework-agnostic design system built with OKLCH colors and a 4px spacing scale.

## Getting Started

Carbon is designed to be simple, accessible, and fast. It outputs static HTML files that can be hosted anywhere.

### Principles

1. **Monochrome First**: Design in grayscale to ensure hierarchy and contrast.
2. **OKLCH Colors**: Perceptually uniform colors for consistent visual harmony.
3. **Vanilla Foundation**: No frameworks. Just HTML, CSS, and minimal JS.
